# The-100-Headed-Snake

I'm embarking on the 100 Days of Code by The App Brewery (https://www.appbrewery.co/).
Here, I'm getting to terms with GitHub by uploading stuff from my 100 Days of Code journey. Enjoy (and branch)!

If you have the wish and motivation to share your thoughts and/or improvements with me, please do!
